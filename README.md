## üß† Overview

Our study reveals a pathway for persistent severe post-COVID syndrome (PCS) involving immune-mediated nasal tissue damage. We show that the TNFŒ±-TGFŒ≤ axis drives aberrant differentiation in the nasal epithelium. Targeting this axis may restore epithelial homeostasis and offer a therapeutic strategy for PCS, akin to treatments in other chronic inflammatory conditions.
